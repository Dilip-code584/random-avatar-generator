Set Up Development Environment:
Ensure Node.js is installed on your system, which will allow you to create the API.

Initialize a New Node.js Project:
Use npm init to create a new Node.js project. This command helps you set up your project by defining details like the project name, version, and entry point.

Install Dependencies:
You need to install necessary packages for your project. In this case, you would install express using the npm install express command.

Create the API:
In your JavaScript file (e.g., app.js), use the express framework to create your API. Define routes for generating avatars, and set up logic to handle user input, including the "seed" and "format" parameters.

Handle User Input:
Utilize query parameters like "seed" and "format" to customize the avatar generation process. The "seed" can be used to specify characteristics of the avatar, and "format" can be used to choose between different file formats (e.g., SVG or PNG).

Generate Avatars:
Implement the logic to generate avatars based on the provided "seed" and "format." You can use libraries or external services to create these avatars.

Serve the Generated Avatar:
Once the avatar is generated, send it as a response to the user's request.

Landing Page and Getting Started Guide:
Create a landing page that introduces your API and its capabilities. Offer a user-friendly guide on how to use the API, including explanations of available parameters, such as "seed" and "format," with examples
